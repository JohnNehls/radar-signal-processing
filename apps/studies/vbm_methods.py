"""Compare VBM noise generation methods.

The VBM (Velocity-Bin Masking) jammer spreads energy across Doppler bins by
modulating the retransmitted signal's phase in slow time. There are several
ways to generate that phase modulation, listed here from simplest to most
physically accurate:

  1. random_phase: each pulse gets an independent random phase — produces
     flat Doppler noise but doesn't respect the prescribed bandwidth.
  2. uniform_bandwidth_phase: random phase filtered to a uniform spectral
     shape within the target bandwidth.
  3. gaussian_bandwidth_phase: random phase filtered to a Gaussian spectral
     shape — more realistic but doesn't match the prescribed width exactly.
  4. gaussian_bandwidth_phase_normalized: same as (3) but normalized.
  5. lfm_phase: slow-time LFM chirp — the only method that precisely matches
     the prescribed rdot_delta bandwidth.

Each method generates an RDM so you can visually compare the Doppler spread.
