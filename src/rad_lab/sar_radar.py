class SarRadar:
    """SAR system parameters (stripmap and spotlight modes).

    All gain and loss fields are linear power ratios (not dB).
    Derived quantities (``n_pulses``, ``wavelength``, ``pulse_spacing``)
    are computed automatically in ``__post_init__``.

    For **stripmap** mode, leave ``scene_center`` as ``None``.
    Optionally set ``beamwidth`` to apply broadside beam-pattern
    weighting (body-fixed antenna).  For **spotlight** mode, set both
    ``scene_center`` and ``beamwidth`` to steer the beam toward a
    fixed scene centre.

    Attributes:
        fcar: Carrier frequency [Hz].
        tx_power: Transmit power [W].
        tx_gain: Transmit antenna gain [linear].
        rx_gain: Receive antenna gain [linear].
        op_temp: Receiver operating temperature [K].
        sample_rate: ADC sampling rate [Hz].
        noise_factor: Receiver noise factor [linear].
        total_losses: Total two-way system losses [linear].
        prf: Pulse repetition frequency [Hz].
        platform_velocity: Platform ground speed along the flight path [m/s].
        aperture_length: Synthetic aperture length [m].
        platform_altitude: Platform altitude above the scene [m].
        scene_center: Scene centre ``[x, y, z]`` that the antenna tracks
            [m].  ``None`` for stripmap mode.  Requires ``beamwidth``.
        beamwidth: One-way 3-dB antenna beamwidth [rad].  In stripmap
            mode (``scene_center=None``), enables broadside beam-pattern
            weighting.  In spotlight mode, weights by the steered beam.
        n_pulses: Number of pulses in the synthetic aperture, computed as
            ``ceil(aperture_length / pulse_spacing)`` [dimensionless].
        wavelength: Carrier wavelength [m], derived from ``fcar``.
        pulse_spacing: Along-track distance between pulses [m], derived from
            ``platform_velocity / prf``.
